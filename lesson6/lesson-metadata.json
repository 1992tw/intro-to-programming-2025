        "description": "You have been working hard this class.  Now it's time to have a little fun!  Since you started learning about git version control last week, and learned a bit more about it this week, we want you to download and play the \"Oh My Git!\" game.  To start, follow <a href=\"https://blinry.itch.io/oh-my-git\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> to the game download instructions.  \n\nPlease read the \"Play on ___?\" information for your operating system as you may need to do a little extra work to get the game running after you've downloaded it.  Once you've read that information, in the Download section below it, click the red Download button for the operating system you use.  \n\nIf downloading isn't working out for you, or you just want a different game to play with this week to practice using git, check this <a href=\"https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Learn Git Branching</a> site out!\n\nThere is no coding assignment to work on or turn in this week so please enter \"no code this week\" in the 'URL' field of your assignment submission form and use the 'Questions' field to share your thoughts on either or both of these games!\n\n**REMINDER**\n\nIf you are completing work on the Algorithms Stretch Goal this lesson, you should go to your \"Lesson 4 - Array Methods and Algorithm Stretch Goal\" repl from last week's coding assignment and work on the practice exercises below the \"Stretch Goal on Algorithms Below\" header in the code.\n",

Then watch the video which helps demonstrate that workflow from the context of team development (multiple people working on the same code base).  Finally, take a look at the Coursera course with \"Module 4 - Collaboration\" being your primary focus.  You do not need to complete the full course, but you're welcome to look at it at your convenience throughout the remainder of the class. \n\n* [Atlassian - using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)\n* [Atlassian - git merge](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge)\n\n[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kHG842HoI)\n\n_**You’ll need to click the link above or click the link where the video would be displayed to redirect to YouTube to watch the video.

You can avoid this by clicking on \"Enroll for Free\" the clicking the small \"Audit this course\" link at the bottom (see image below...)

If you did start (or even finish it!) feel free to continue practicing with algorithms after your deeper look at git this week.  Here is the content from last week's lesson copied to this week's lesson so you do not have to switch back and forth: \n\n## _**STRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL): Intro to Algorithms**_\n- **[Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/javascript-interview-challenges-c02c/~00) - JavaScript Interview Challenges**\n- Watch and practice the first 5 videos (with solutions). Try to solve each algorithm before you watch the solution. The more you practice the more comfortable you will you get, which is good preparation for job interviewing.\n\n### Algorithms\n\nThink about it: you've been low-key using algorithms since your elementary school days. Yep, those step-by-step instructions for multiplying numbers? Bingo, those are algorithms!\n\nNow, let's break it down a bit. An **algorithm** is like a super precise recipe for solving a computer puzzle. Simple, right? But wait, what's a **computational problem**? Well, it's basically a riddle that a computer can help us solve. For example, think about sorting a jumbled mess of numbers into a neat little order. That's a computational problem.\n\nSo, when we talk about problems, we're talking about spelling them out really clearly. That means telling the computer exactly what it's working with – the stuff going in, what's supposed to come out, and how they're all connected. This is similar to using AI as well. You have to write a very detailed prompt when communicating with AI or you may get missing or incorrect information back.\n\nAn algorithm is like a secret recipe that lays out a series of steps. If you stick to those steps exactly as they're written, voilà, you'll solve the problem! It's like having multiple paths to victory in a game – as long as you follow the rules, you'll win!\n\n1. Read this [article](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-a-very-brief-intro-to-cs) on Odin. \n2. Read this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/).  We won’t be getting into the types of algorithms but it’s a good overview of how algorithms are part of a developer’s daily life. \n3. Once again, same info, but [a video](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/v/what-are-algorithms) from Khan Academy.\n\n_**You can always search for algorithm problem practice and/or keep working with and practicing the Interview Challenges from Scrimba at the top of this section.  If you didn't complete the practice exercises at the bottom of your Lesson 4 replit you can revisit those too!**_\n",
